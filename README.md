# FaceLandmarkDetection

## Early approaches: Fitting a deformable face mesh using strong priors.
- Active Shape Model
- Active Appearance Model
- Constrained Local Model
- Only achieve good results in controlled environments (frontal face and proper lightning).

## Established methods: 
- ERT: cascade based on gradient boosting. (available in dlib)
- MultiTask Cascaded CNN: 

## Modern developments:
- Dense Face Alignment
- Style Aggregated Network
- Look at Boundary  
- Wing Loss
- PFLD
- AWing
- Geometry Aggregated Network
- Deep Adaptive Graph
