# FaceLandmarkDetection

## Early approaches: Fitting a deformable face mesh using strong priors.
  Active Shape Model
  Active Appearance Model
  Constrained Local Model
  Only achieve good results in controlled environments (frontal face and proper lightning).

## Established methods: 
  ERT: cascade based on gradient boosting. (available in dlib)
  MultiTask Cascaded CNN: 

## Modern developments:
  Dense Face Alignment
  Style Aggregated Network
  Look at Boundary  
  Wing Loss
  PFLD
  AWing
  Geometry Aggregated Network
  Deep Adaptive Graph
